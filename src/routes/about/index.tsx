      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The Full-Circle Learning (FCL) educational model was piloted in 1992 in Los Angeles California, initially to
help traumatized learners re-envision their capacities and connections by embracing their role as societyâ€™s
change agents.</p>
      <p>The nonprofit organization of the same name, based on this educational model, has trained participants
across 40 nations at this writing. In any given year, up to a dozen countries also receive community impact
grants, capacity building programs, wisdom exchange alliances, and scholarships in regions where public
education is not free. (Pictured, a fundraiser in Nevada City, California)</p>
      <p>This nonprofit organization, headquartered in the USA, is operated by a board of directors who bring
diverse backgrounds and unique professional experiences to educator development services. Their career
assets include curriculum development, writing and research, human resources, and teaching and/or
administering at universities, school districts, individual schools, and complementary learning or arts
programs. Board members bring 200 years of collective experience to the organization.</p>
