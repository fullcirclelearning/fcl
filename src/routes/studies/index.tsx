      <p class="font-bold">Assessment Summary</p>
      <p>This study reviewed the secondary research materials of testimonials, data, and reports
conducted over the years of Full Circle Learning’s (FCL’s) operations for which print data is
available [2002 - 2022].</p>
      <p>Full-Circle Learning has provided direct student service as well as professional development to
an ever-widening circle of schools and teachers, over time. The database compiled
assessment results in each indicator area, per location, per year.</p>
      <p>Reviewing the now organized data sheet, one may see countless qualitative stories of the high
impact FCL has had on the lives of youth, educators, and their communities. Additionally, the
programs connect classrooms from across the world, leading students to inspire, learn from,
and feel connected with one another and with their global community. In fact, connection and a
holistic perspective of “one human family” seems to be at the center of the FCL curriculum.
Students learn conflict resolution, which has led to relationships being repaired, and in extreme
situations, entire communities and countries being repaired by the leadership of young FCL
Learners. Students learn from those around them through truly listening and learn to work
together to solve huge and small social issues.</p>
<p>Throughout the reports, there are countless accounts of educators and community members
reporting the tremendous impact and changes they’ve seen in their students, classrooms, and
community. Indicators show students more engaged and committed to their schooling, and classroom culture seems to peak in the highest models of what it means to be altruistic. This
modeling offered experiences that influenced many students to develop healthy mental models
of the world and perhaps to understand their place in the world through self- actualized action
and community support.</p>
<p>
The most noticed components found in the students’ holistic development is feeling connected
with their community and full of hope. Students seem to take responsibility for their part to play
in making the world a better place and to accept a sense of purpose in actualizing it. The
transformation of vulnerable communities seems to come from these youth understanding the
issues and taking steps to directly heal the harmed or neglected aspects of their communities.
For example, students may grow and bring food to elders facing food insecurity. They may
research about the pests and crop damage happening, find solutions, and share it with
farmers, directly solving their problem. They may run health campaigns teaching their
community how to have good hygiene and stop the spread of deadly viruses. There was a
young girl who learned how to create cheap, natural water filters and shared them with her
community. Through helping heal and support their communities, it seems they embrace a
sense of ownership, pride, and belonging.
</p>
<p>
The countless issues are solved by these FCL students through active learning and organizing,
processes that teach them how to be active altruistic changemakers in their communities.
Community members and the educators seem to become inspired by them, and, in most
cases, it is apparent that the community relationships strengthen and form through their
actions. Not only are relationships and projects built locally, creating a nested community, but
students connect across continents and across the world, supporting, learning, and inspiring
one another. This seems to create understanding across divides in culture and helps students
feel they belong to the human family.
</p>
<p>
FCL truly seems to develop communities from the bottom up, starting at the fostering of new
life for young people, who inspire and help heal their communities and lead the way, as
excellent models of holistically minded and highly moral individuals, who become connected
with a strong sense of purpose to protect and support the communities to which they feel
connected.

<p class="font-bold">Other Studies</p>
<p>A five-year independent study prior to this one also established increases in grade
equivalency based on the number of months or years of a student’s exposure to the curricula
and culture of a Full-Circle Learning school. Up to 84% of students improved not only their
motivation to learn but their actual skill sets (measured through Wrat 4 and Gray Oral Reading
tests).</p>
<p>
Virtually universal growth was also documented at multiple sites from 2000 - 2020 through
annual “19 Indicators” parent surveys, which measure academic and socio-emotional growth
beyond grade-level expectations.
