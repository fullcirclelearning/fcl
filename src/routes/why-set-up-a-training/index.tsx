and quantitative results by applying their Full-Circle Learning training.</p></li>
        <li><p>Experts in the field facilitate the learning. Both professional development and graded
Full-Circle Learning education courses are available either onsite or via zoom or in
small-group online sessions.</p></li>

vulnerable regions of the world, where student projects address sustainability goals
(the right to peace, food security, health, equity, economic wellbeing, and the
reduction of environmental or climate change impacts).</p></li>
